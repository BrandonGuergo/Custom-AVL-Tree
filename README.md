Custom‑AVL‑Tree is a self‑implemented version of an AVL tree, a type of self‑balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one, ensuring efficient operations like search, insertion, and deletion in logarithmic time. This project demonstrates hands‑on understanding of fundamental data structures by building the tree logic and balancing rotations from scratch, complete with support for core operations and automated tests (e.g., using the provided Catch2 template) to validate correctness. It’s a great example of applying algorithmic concepts to create a robust, well‑tested data structure in a real development environment — a solid addition to any portfolio highlighting competence in DSA fundamentals, implementation rigor, and test‑driven development.
